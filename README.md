The application was made in a CMPT 395 class for the MacEwan Continuing Education department. It is a scheduling program which takes in number of students per program and outputs a schedule for rooms as well as cohorts.

Bugs found:
The whole application works but for the schedules in the extra rooms; it does not fill the extra rooms optimally
