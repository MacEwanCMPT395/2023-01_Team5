STORIES:
1. As a Program Manager, I want to create the right numbers of cohorts, so I can evenly distribute the students in 
each of our seven programs
2. As a Scheduler, I would like to have cohorts clearly matched with their classrooms for all the lectures, so I can 
properly book the rooms.
3, As a Program Manager, I want the cohorts to use the proper naming convention, so I can easily identify them
for our seven programs (e.g., PM0101, PM0102, PM0201, DXD0302).

Want to give some extra space when schedule the cohort
